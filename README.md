# Polimi Webex Downloader

Since a webex update broke [the extension that we were using to download polimi lessons from webex](https://github.com/jacopo-j/WebXDownloader), i decided to write a new extension **that does not rely on url matching.**

For now it's only compatible with Google Chrome, but feel free to fork and PR the compatibility with other browsers.

## Install (Chrome)

* Download the `.zip` file clicking [**here**](https://github.com/lorossi/polimi-webex-downloader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Extract the zip file
* Browse to `chrome://extensions`
* Turn on "Developer mode" on the top right
* Click "Load unpacked extension..." on the top left
* Select the folder to which your zip file was extracted.
